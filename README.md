<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Project

This GitHub action implements the level 1 requirements of the [SLSA framework](https://slsa.dev/). By using this GitHub Action it is possible to easily generate the provenance file for different artifact types.
Different artifact types include:
* Files
* Push to some API (Docker Hub, different workflow)

While there are no integrity guarantees on the produced provenance at L1,
publishing artifact provenance in a common format opens up opportunities for
automated analysis and auditing. Additionally, moving build definitions into
source control and onto well-supported, secure build systems represents a marked
improvement from the ecosystem's current state.


This is not an official GitHub Action set up and maintained by the SLSA team. This GitHub Action is built for research purposes by Philips Research. It is heavily inspired by the original [Provenance Action example](https://github.com/slsa-framework/github-actions-demo) built by SLSA.

## Background

[SLSA](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa) is a framework intended to codify
and promote secure software supply-chain practices. SLSA helps trace software
artifacts (e.g. binaries) back to the build and source control systems that
produced them using in-toto's
[Attestation](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md)
metadata format.

## Usage

The easiest way to use this Action is to add the following into your workflow file. Additional configuration might be nessecary to fit your usecase.

1. Add the following part in your workflow file:
   ```yaml
   generate-provenance:
    name: Generate build provenance
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: artifact/

      - name: Generate provenance
        uses: philips-labs/SLSA-Provenance-Action@8c78a6b34703824b9561a26b1ae5893beea9a332
        with:
          artifact_path: artifact/

      - name: Upload provenance
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: build.provenance
   ```
